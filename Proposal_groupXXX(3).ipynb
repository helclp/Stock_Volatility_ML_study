    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project must include some elements of unsupervised learning, but you are welcome to include some supervised or other learning approaches as well.\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "\n",
    "After conducting background research on our topic of interest, we identified that the vast majority of machine learning literature frequently uses k-means clustering (a simple algorithm which assumes spherical/circular covariance) when conducting studies on stock data. Our group seeks to understand how clustering and pattern recognition will change when using a more robust and flexible algorithm. Gaussian mixture models are our current algorithm of choice as they can assume a wider array of covariance shape when conducting machine learning research on stock data. This enables us to cluster based on more irregular or less easily separable data. We hope to uncover new insights and better pattern recognition in our research. Our goal from this endeavor is to find potential worthwhile stock investments based on our clustering. "
